       SOLID
       S- Single Responsibility -  A class should have only one reason to change, meaning
                                   it should have only one job or responsibility..
       O- Open for extension and close for modification- existing code should extendable not for modification because
                                                          it can break existing functionality
       L- Liskov substitution - child object should be replaceable without effecting the parent functionality
       I- Interface Segregation - Dont force class to override method from an interface create new interface
       D- Dependency inversion - High level module should not depends on low level module
